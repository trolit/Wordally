<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

Wordally is a digital tool designed to facilitate efficient and effective vocabulary learning for diverse language learners, bridging the gap between desire and attainment in language acquisition. 

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

Wordally, an innovative digital solution, revolutionizes the process of learning foreign language vocabulary, whether for academic advancement or enhancement of personal lexicon. Drawing inspiration from the author's personal journey in English language learning, the platform leverages a three-step method to optimize vocabulary retention and recall, minimizing time investment and maximizing learning outcomes. Users engage in iterative exercises, covering and guessing words, writing translations, and repetitive practice to solidify memory, with potential for substantial vocabulary mastery within a concise 30-minute session.

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

- Use Wordally by clicking on [this link](https://trolit.github.io/Wordally/).
- Initially intended to automatically provide translations using Marak's [translate.js](https://github.com/marak/translate.js/) library, Wordally now necessitates manual input of translations due to API limitations. However, Wordally compensates by allowing users to generate URLs for easy sharing and replication of word/translation templates.
